# C-Breeze User Documentation

### This is a few notes to help users get started with their C-breeze install.

##Steps to follow:

1. Copy all the requisite files into your root directory of your webserver.
    Files include: 
    
        * Styles
        * js
        * data
        * app.php
        * login.html
        * header.html
        * asc.php
        * ascf.php
        * asu.php
        * index.php
        * uikit-2.10.0
    
2. Navigate to the web domain associated with the server you have installed the files on
    You should be on the `login.html` page.
3. Login with the root credentials, these should be `root@root.com` for the email and password `root`
4. You will be presented with a white screen, here hover on "root" in the top right and click on Settings
5. Click on the Admin tab in the pop out modal
6. Add yourself and your other teammates through the add user section of the pop out
    All added users' initialized passwords will be `seamonkey`, when everyone logs in make sure they change their passwords to what they want
    Make sure to only make some users admins, only those you trust with ability to remove users
7. Go to the Add Column field and add in the columns you expect to use in order of how you would like them shown to you
    They will start from the left side of your screen most likely
8. Once you have added all the columns you want, and the users, click the Edit Card Format button
9. You will be presented with another pop out that will have some fields to fill in
10. We suggest you have a short text field for a Description, and maybe a Long text field for notes
11. Once you have filled out the fields you plan on using click Ok at the bottom of the pop out
12. Now logout of the root user by hovering over "root" in the top right corner, and clicking logout
13. Log back in to your account you created for yourself
14. You will be presented with the columns you made previously
15. Hover over the empty space in the top right and click on "Settings"
16. Set your username, something that other teammates will recognize you by
17. Set a new password for your account, something that only you will remember
18. Select your choice background color, this will only affect how you see the columns

### You are now done with setup of the application
### Below are some general notes on how to do things:
To edit a card click on the small edit icon in the top right of the card which you wish to edit.
To add a card click on the "Add Card" text in the top right area of the screen

### Some Important Notes:

Always make sure that there is at least one column left on the site, when changing all columns, leave at least one and then add the new columns in the order you want them and remove the left over column!
